        OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.

        For normal program, the method can handle the data for dddo certain operations.
        But in OOPS, the object can handle both methods and data.

        OOPS makes the code faster and easier to execute.
        It makes the clear structure for the program.
        OOPS follow DRY(Don't repeat yourself). It means reducing the repeating code. It makes the easier to maintain, debug, modify.
        It helps to provide shorter development time.


        OOPS concepts,

        (i) Class
        (ii) Object
        (iii) Inheritance
        (iv) Abstraction
        (v) Polymorphism
        (vi) Encapsulation

        (i) Class:
            Collection of object is called class.
            A class also can be defined as blueprint which you can create an individual objects.
            A class doesn't consume any memory space.

        (ii) Object:
            Any entity that has state and behaviour is known as object.
            An object defined as instance of class.
            An object contains address and take some space in memory.
            Objects can communicate without knowing the details of data.
            Objects only carry about the type of messages accepted and type of response returned by the object.

        (iii) Inheritance:
            When one object or class acquire all the properties and behaviour of parent object or class.
            It provides code reusability.

        (iv) Abstraction:
            Hiding internal details and show functionality is called abstraction.
            We use abstract and interfaces to achieve abstraction.
        
        (v) Polymorphism:
            If one task performed in different way is called polymorphism.
            We use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.

        (vi) Encapsulation:
            Binding or wrapping code and data together is called encapsulation.
